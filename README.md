# Digit-Recognizer

This project allows you to draw a digit and the machine learning model will recognize the digit along with its certainty in its answer.

The code also includes a self contained method for training a densely connected neural network with any number of layers and nodes at each layer. You can also see the training and test accuracy at each epoch of the training. To train a model using the code you have to change the source, there is currently no direct way of using it with the GUI.
